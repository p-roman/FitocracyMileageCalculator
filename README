Calculates the total distance you ran, based on Fitocracy data export.

To use, download this script and a CSV of your running data from Fitocracy (You -> Performance -> Running -> CSV). Put both files in the same directory. Make sure that the CSV file contains a column named "Combined" and that it has data (distance, pace, time, etc.) for each row. If some of the rows don't have distance in this column, the script will not work correctly.
